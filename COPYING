resdet bundles KISS FFT under the lib/kissfft/ subdirectory and includes it in some binary configurations; this is redistributed according to the terms of its license under lib/kissfft/COPYING.

All other source files are copyright the resdet authors and distributed according to the terms below:

libresdet (the contents of the include/ and lib/ directories excluding lib/kissfft) is distributed under the terms of the LGPL v2.1. See COPYING.LGPL.
It is the author's interpretation of the LGPL that the static linking exception applies -- an application statically linking with libresdet need not be distributed under the LGPL itself so long as any included changes to libresdet are made available under the terms of the LGPL.

Source files outside of lib/ such as the resdet CLI tools and build scripts are distributed under the more permissive MIT license. See COPYING.MIT.
